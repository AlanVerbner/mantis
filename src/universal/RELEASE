Issues Fixed Since Last Release

EC-269 JSON RPC network_version returns a value of 1 for morden network, correct version is 2

EC-270 personal_importRawKey allows the same key to be imported several times

EC-282 download gets stuck in a loop when downloading block headers from a single peer which doesn't have those block headers

EC-174 Releases not signed. Potential security issue whereby neither our releases nor the components used to build our releases are signed as verified.

EC-283 Keyfiles exported from MyEtherwallet do not work

EC-278 Killing the client during fast download *might* result in missing block header

EC-268 Pending transactions may not get forwarded to new peers. A connection made to a peer when a transaction is already pending will not receive the pending transaction.

EC-265 Spurious "Could not open table" database error during regular sync.

EC-244 etcstats.net data for mantis always seems one block behind

EC-167 Trying to run "regular sync" after an incomplete "fast sync" results in "Node not found" exception

Known Issues

EC-254 Full discovery 'kademlia' protocol not implemented. There are no known implications.
